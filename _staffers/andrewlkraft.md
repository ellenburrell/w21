Hi I'm Andrew, a third year CS major and ULA for W21's cs130b class! I think the mathy side of CS is really cool, so I enjoy things like designing algorithms, machine learning, cryptography etc. To me, one of the best things about CS is taking a theoretical algorithm based in math, and actually implementing it into code so that it works as intended. Outside of class, I like to sing, hike, watch movies, and go to the gym, although since Covid I've been kinda slacking on the last one. I'm also a part of the acapella community on campus. Feel free to stop by my office hours if you wanna talk about CS or anything else.
