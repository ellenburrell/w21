Hiya! My name Clare and I'm a senior in Computer Science. This is my first time being a ULA and I look forward to helping improve your experience learning the material in CS154. As if I wasn't on my computer enough, I also enjoy video games and at the moment, am playing through Raft. I'm also obsessed with cats and you might see my cat, Athena, trying to block my view of the computer screen from time to time when she gets extra needy. If you need any help, just want to chat, or meet one of my cats, feel free to come to my office hours Wednesday from 4 to 6 PM. =^_^=
