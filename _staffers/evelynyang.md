Hi everyone! I’m Evelyn, a third-year Computer Science major and I’m super excited to be tutoring for CS8 this quarter! This is my first time tutoring for a CS course, so I’m a little nervous, but excited to get to know everyone. Although I haven’t taken CS8, the introduction to computer science course I took was what initially got me interested in CS, and I hope to help you all discover a similar passion for computer science through this course!
In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, and avoiding the outdoors as much as possible :) Looking forward to meeting everyone!!
