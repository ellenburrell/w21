Hello my name is Rory! I'm a thid year CS major, and a ULA for Professor Matni's CS 64 this winter quarter! In CS my interests lie in the more theoretical side of things such as Programming Languages
so I'm trying to learn more PL related things at the moment. Outisde of class, I enjoy powerlifting, rock climbing, playing guitar, surfing, and helping out with the UCSB Robotics team as VP!
If you ever want to chat about CS stuff, robotics, or anything at all feel free to come to my office hours on Monday from 4-6pm PST.
