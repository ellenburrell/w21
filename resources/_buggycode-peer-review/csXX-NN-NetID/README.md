# Buggy code for CS 190 from CS XX

## Contributed by YOURNAME

### Instructions
Delete these instructions in your final submission, only updating YOURNAME and the "Programming Question" and "Conceptual Questions" sections accordingly.

* Copy the directory/folder `CSXX-NN-NetID`
   * replace the `XX` with your course number
   * set the `NN` to `01`
   * set the NetID in the folder name to _your_ NetID.
* Make sure that you add your directory to the `resources/_buggycode-peer-review`
* If you have more than one example to contribute, then create a new directory `CSXX-NN-NetID` and increment the `NN` accordingly.

* Submit a buggy student code - call it `buggy.ext`
  * submit the file with the appropriate extension, e.g., `ext` can be .py, .cpp, .ipynb
  * include the files necessary to run your submission (e.g., the Makefile, the data file(s))
  * leave only the relevant code necessary to understand the problem
  * redact any student-specific information

### Programming question

Referring to the buggy file that you submitted, include any relevant questions that a student may ask about it. 

For example,
 >   buggy.cpp: When computing estimate for pi, students have a question: "when I input 1 the first time, it works. But after it, the number is way off. I don't understand what is going on." (The code is in buggy.cpp)

### Conceptual questions

Include questions that students asked that relate to concepts and code.

For example, 
*  When to use a `for` loop vs. a `while` loop?
*  What is the difference between a reference and a pointer?

#### Adding required files using the GitHub interface 

If you are not adding these files from the command line and instead prefer to use the GitHub website, then this section is for you.
* Navigate to the `resources/_buggycode-peer-review` folder on GitHub _in your forked repo_.
* Select “Create new file” from the “Add file” dropdown.
* Name your file `CSXX-NN-NetID/README.md`
  * Update `XX` and `NN` according to the instructions above
  * Notice that when you type a slash `/`, GitHub automatically knows that it will be creating a new folder into which it will place your `README.md`.
* Add the following sections to your README and update them accordingly:
```
